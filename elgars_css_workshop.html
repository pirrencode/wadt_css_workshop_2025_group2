    <h1 class="title">What is Sass? Your guide to this top CSS preprocessor</h1>

    <i>By Tammy Coron January 10, 2020</i>

    <h2>Discover what Sass is, and learn how to start using it.</h2>

    <p>
      What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web
      design, you've probably heard the term floating around, but you might not
      be quite up to speed with exactly what Sass is, what it does, and whether
      or not you should be using it. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which
      adds special features such as variables, nested rules and mixins
      (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The aim is to
      make the coding process simpler and more efficient. Let's explore in more
      detail.

    <h3>What is a CSS preprocessor?</h3>

    <p>
      A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing
      developers to write code in one language and then compile it into CSS.
      Sass is perhaps the most popular preprocessor around right now, but other
      well-known examples include Less and Stylus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before we go any further, a quick public service announcement is in order:
      most web designers would say that if you're new to CSS, you're better off
      avoiding Sass (or any preprocessors, extensions or frameworks) while
      you're still learning. While it's true they offer many advantages in speed
      and efficiency, it's important that you really get to grips with the
      basics of CSS. Make sure you learn the core concepts before you start
      exploring shortcuts and confusing things.
    </p>

    <h3>What is Sass?</h3>

    <p>Sass is arguably the most useful of all CSS extensions.</p>

    <p>
      Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets') is an
      extension of CSS that enables you to use things like variables, nested
      rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and
      allows you to create style sheets faster.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for
      using it is that you must have Ruby installed. Users are also asked to
      follow the Sass Community Guidelines.
    </p>

    <h3>How to use Sass</h3>

    <p>
      In the following section, we'll outline some basic tips for using Sass,
      using examples from the official Sass website. Take a look at the
      <a
        href="https://sass-lang.com/documentation"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener noreferrer"
        >Sass Documentation</a
      >
      for additional references and examples.
    </p>

    <h4>Syntax</h4>

    <p>Sass includes two syntax options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant
        with CSS syntax
      </li>
      <li>
        Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and
        indentation rather than brackets; it is not fully compliant with CSS
        syntax, but it's quicker to write
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the
      <code>sass-convert</code> command.
    </p>

    <h4>Variables</h4>

    <p>
      Just like other programming languages, Sass allows the use of variables
      that can store information you can use throughout your style sheet. For
      example, you can store a colour value in a variable at the top of the
      file, and then use this variable when setting the colour of your elements.
      This enables you to quickly change your colours without having to modify
      each line separately.
    </p>

    <p>For example:</p>

    <pre><code>
$font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif;
$primary-color: #333;

body {
  font: 100% $font-stack;
  color: $primary-color;
}
  </code></pre>

    <p>The following CSS will be produced:</p>

    <pre><code>
body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  color: #333;
}
  </code></pre>

    <h4>Nesting</h4>

    <p>
      Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it provides an excellent method for
      reducing the amount of code you need to write, it can also lead to
      over-qualified CSS if not executed carefully. The idea is to nest your CSS
      selectors in such a way as to mimic your HTML hierarchy.
    </p>

    <p>The following shows a basic navigation style that uses nesting:</p>

    <pre><code>
nav {
  ul {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    list-style: none;
  }

  li {
    display: inline-block;
  }

  a {
    display: block;
    padding: 6px 12px;
    text-decoration: none;
  }
}
  </code></pre>

    <p>The CSS output is as follows:</p>

    <pre><code>
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

nav li {
  display: inline-block;
}

nav a {
  display: block;
  padding: 6px 12px;
  text-decoration: none;
}
  </code></pre>

    <h4>Partials</h4>

    <p>
      Partials are smaller Sass files that can be imported (see next section)
      into other Sass files. Think of partials as code snippets. With these code
      snippets, your CSS can now be modular and easier to maintain. A partial is
      designated as such by naming it with a leading underscore:
      <code>_partial.scss</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Import</h4>

    <p>
      Used with Partials, the <code>@import</code> directive allows you to
      import your partial files into the current file, to build one single CSS
      file. Be mindful of how many imports you're using as an HTTP request will
      be generated for each one.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
// _reset.scss
html,
body,
ul,
ol {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

// basefile.scss
@import 'reset';

body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  background-color: #efefef;
}
  </code></pre>

    <p>The corresponding CSS output:</p>

    <pre><code>
html, body, ul, ol {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}

body {
  font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;
  background-color: #efefef;
}
  </code></pre>

    <p>
      Note: When importing partials, you don't need to include the file
      extension or the underscore.
    </p>

    <h4>Mixins</h4>

    <p>
      One of the advantages of using preprocessors is their ability to take
      complex, long-winded code and simplify it. This is where mixins come in
      handy!
    </p>

    <p>
      For example, if you need to include the vendor prefixes, you can use a
      mixin instead. Take a look at this example for border-radius:
    </p>

    <pre><code>
@mixin border-radius($radius) {
  -webkit-border-radius: $radius;
  -moz-border-radius: $radius;
  -ms-border-radius: $radius;
  border-radius: $radius;
}

.box {
  @include border-radius(10px);
}
  </code></pre>

    <p>The CSS produced:</p>

    <pre><code>
.box {
  -webkit-border-radius: 10px;
  -moz-border-radius: 10px;
  -ms-border-radius: 10px;
  border-radius: 10px;
}
  </code></pre>

    <h4>Extend / Inheritance</h4>

    <p>
      The <code>@extend</code> directive has been called one of Sass' most
      powerful features. With it, you avoid repeating yourself and let selectors
      inherit styles from others, keeping code DRY.
    </p>

    <h4>Operators</h4>

    <p>
      Sass allows calculations in CSS like addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division, plus functions like percentage(), floor(),
      and round().
